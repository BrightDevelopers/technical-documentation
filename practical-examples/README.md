## Example Structure

Each example in this repository follows a consistent structure:

```
example-name/
├── README.md           # Description, requirements, and usage
├── src/                # Source code files
├── assets/             # Media and resource files (if applicable)
└── autorun.brs         # Entry point (for BrightScript examples)
```

## Running Examples

### On Physical Hardware

1. Copy the example folder contents to an SD card or USB drive
2. Insert the storage media into your BrightSign player
3. Power on (or reboot) the player
4. The example will run automatically

### Using the Diagnostic Web Server

1. Connect to your player's diagnostic web server
2. Navigate to the SD card upload section
3. Upload the example files
4. Reboot the player
