BrightScript is the native scripting language for BrightSign players, offering direct access to hardware capabilities and optimal performance for media playback and device control.

**What you'll learn:**

- BrightScript language syntax, types, and built-in functions
- Working with BrightSign objects for video, audio, images, and networking
- Practical development patterns and best practices
- Debugging techniques using the serial console and telnet
- Design patterns for robust, maintainable applications
- Plugin architecture for extending functionality

BrightScript is ideal for applications requiring tight hardware integration, low-level control, or maximum performance.
